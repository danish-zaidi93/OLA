OLA Data Analysis

The goal of the project is to analyze the 1 month data to solve the problem statement of stakeholder.

Problem statements are given below:-

Ride Volume Over Time

Booking Status Breakdown

Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance

Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type

cancelled Rides Reasons

Revenue by Payment Method

Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value

Ride Distance Distribution Per Day

Driver Ratings Distribution

Customer vs. Driver Ratings

Segregation of the views:

1. Overall-

-Ride Volume Over Time

-Booking Status Breakdown

2. Vehicle Type

-Revenue by Payment Method

-Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value

-Ride Distance Distribution Per Day

4. Cancellation-

Cancelled Rides Reasons (Customer)
-cancelled Rides Reasons(Drivers)

5. Ratings-

Driver Ratings
-Customer Ratings

To solve the above problem state I have used different different metrics and charts to analyze the data

➡️ Ride Volume Over Time: A time-series chart showing the number of rides per day/week.

➡️ Booking Status Breakdown: A pie or doughnut chart displaying the proportion of different booking statuses (success, cancelled by the customer, cancelled by the driver, etc.).

➡️ Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance: A bar chart ranking vehicle types based on the total distance covered.

➡️ Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type: A column chart showing the average customer ratings for different vehicle types.

➡️ cancelled Rides Reasons: A bar chart that highlights the common reasons for ride cancellations by customers and drivers.

➡️ Revenue by Payment Method: A stacked bar chart displaying total revenue based on payment methods (Cash, UPI, Credit Card, etc.).

➡️ Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value: A leaderboard visual listing customers who have spent the most on bookings.

➡️ Ride Distance Distribution Per Day: A histogram or scatter plot showing the distribution of ride distances for different Dates.

➡️ Driver Rating Distribution: A box plot visualizing the spread of driver ratings for different vehicle types.

➡️ Customer vs. Driver Ratings: A scatter plot comparing customer and driver ratings for each completed ride, analyzing correlations
